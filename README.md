We are going to analyze the **data** from multiple patients' electrocardiograms, labeled as either at risk of cardiovascular disease or not at risk.

The **objective** of this exercise is to train a model that is able to learn from this dataset and detect the risk of cardiovascular disease in new patients' electrocardiograms.

This is a machine learning **classification problem**, so we are going to test different models, analyze their performance metrics and select the best one for our objective.
